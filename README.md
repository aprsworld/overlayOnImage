# overlayOnImage
This project allows the user to customize what they want to put on their webpage. The user can import any image they want and import any json data that they want as long as the server allows the user to use that json data. The user can also add their own messages to the webpage by clicking on the 'add more textfields' button. 

To run this program, currently all you have to do is open the 'index.html' file in a browser. 

Warning, there are still alot of bugs in the program. Some include refresh interval does not work and you cannot remove an image once you add it. It also does not save the information you added to the page yet.  


Specifications: 

- 1 movable image that is selected by the user
- 1 location to pull json data from
- movable spans = these spans will come from either from json or custom made by the user
- ability to change the font size of the spans
- refreshInterval for the json spans to update on a 10, 30, or 60 second interval
