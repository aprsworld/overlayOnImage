# overlayOnImage
This project allows the user to customize what they want to put on their webpage. The user can import any image they want and import any json data that they want as long as the server allows the user to use that json data. The user can also add their own messages to the webpage by clicking on the 'add more textfields' button. 

To run this program, first you need to store this file on a server. Then, you can access the file by the 'index.html' file.

Warning, there are still alot of bugs in the program. The program does not check to see if the URL you give it actually exists. This is for both the JSON and Image input textfields.  


<b>Specifications:</b> 

- 1 location to pull json data from
- movable spans = these spans will come from either from json or custom made by the user
- ability to change the font size of the spans
- refreshInterval for the json spans to update on a 10, 30, or 60 second interval
- 1 immovable, not scaled down image
